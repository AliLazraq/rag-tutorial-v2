In the ancient kingdom of Eltheria, nestled between the Stormcaller Mountains and the Whispering Forests, there lived a young scribe named Alarion.
His days were filled with ink and parchment, but his heart burned for adventure. When a strange black obelisk rose from the heart of the forest, pulsing with forgotten magic,
Alarion knew his destiny had changed. Despite warnings from the elders, he journeyed into the forest, encountering enchanted creatures, deceptive spirits,
and a druidic order sworn to guard the obelisk’s secrets.

As Alarion deciphered ancient glyphs, he discovered the obelisk was a prison—holding back a time-warped sorcerer from the age before stars.
To keep the realm from being torn asunder, Alarion forged an alliance with the last skyborn dragon, Vaereth, who had once been bound by the same magic.
Together, they battled the fractured spirits of the forest and confronted the sorcerer in the Astral Vale,
where time collapsed and memory fought reality. With a final stroke of runic flame, Alarion sealed the rift—becoming the first Archsage in over a thousand years.
