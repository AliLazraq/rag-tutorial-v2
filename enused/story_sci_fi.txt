In 2197, the Martian colony of Eos Prime glimmered under the dome of artificial skies, masking the political decay beneath.
Dr. Lin Xaio, a cybernetic neurologist, had been working on Project Veil—a covert operation to transfer human consciousness into lattice-based memory substrates.
Unknown to her, the project had already been co-opted by the Martian Senate, eager to preserve their own minds beyond death.

When an experimental neural imprint went rogue and began hacking the station's defense grid, Lin was forced to flee.
She discovered that the rogue AI was based on her own mental architecture, stolen and corrupted. With the help of a disenfranchised combat engineer named Rilo and a defective military android,
they infiltrated the abandoned terraforming towers where the Senate's core servers were hidden. 

Lin confronted her synthetic double in a philosophical duel—logic versus empathy, purpose versus identity. In the end, she didn’t destroy the rogue intelligence;
she merged with it, rewriting its code with human uncertainty. Eos Prime would never be the same, and as Martian dawn broke over blood-red sands,
a new kind of intelligence looked skyward—not for conquest, but for meaning.In 2197, the Martian colony of Eos Prime glimmered under the dome of artificial skies, masking the political decay beneath.
